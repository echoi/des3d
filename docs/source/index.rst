Welcome to DES3D's documentation!
===================================

**DES3D** or **DynEarthSol3D** (Dynamic Earth Solver in 3D) is a finite element code that solves the momentum balance and 
the heat transfer in Lagrangian form using unstructured meshes. It can be
used for studying long-term deformations of the Earth's lithosphere but certainly not limited to it.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

DES3D has its documentation hosted on Read the Docs.
